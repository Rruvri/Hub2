Hello! 
This is the second version of RaviHUB, a life managing central space that I am building alongside my Python learning!
The previous version had item management for stuff at home, memos and goals, reminders to buy e.g. groceries
[!] is To-Do, [->] completed or in progress


=== CURRENT FEATURES ===

== Completed:
+ Time-based tracking, day periods for routines etc.
+ Save system with Pickle
+ Basic Daily goals tracking

== Now working on:
-> Daily goals tracking
    -> Complete/ edit goals
        -> If completed, move up next goals
    ! Move dict interactions to a general function for DRY reuse
    ! Decorator for while true menu holding




=== ROADMAPish... ===
! Move over or redo item, memo collections
